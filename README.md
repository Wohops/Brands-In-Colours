### About "Brands in Colours"
> "What's the colour of the Twitter logo again?"

Have you ever said that when designing or developing a website? Yes? Me too. I often use websites such as [Social Media Colors](http://redpik.github.io/social-media-colors/) as a reminder but when coding CSS, I always end up fetching the same informations.

"Brands in colours" is a simple SASS list of variables that you can add to your projects so you'll never have to go look for the colour of that YouTube logo ever again.

### Reference site
As just a list of SASS variables is not really sexy, I also made [this small webpage](http://loriskumo.github.io/Brands-In-Colours/) that you can use as a colour reference when designing. I will keep adding new colours in time but I think we have a nice list for starters.

### How to use it
Just grab the [Brands In Colours source SASS file](https://github.com/loriskumo/Brands-In-Colours/blob/gh-pages/stylesheets/sass/_brandsincolours.scss) and plug it in your own project. As simple as that. The variables look like _$nameofthebrand-bic_, simply use those in your SASS files. (the suffix "-bic" was added to avoid conflicts with other variables that may already use that name)
If you don't use SASS, you can still use it as a text reference, even the RGB values are available. :-)

### Contribute
If you feel like I'm missing something, don't hesitate to add colours to the [_brandsincolours.sass](https://github.com/loriskumo/Brands-In-Colours/blob/gh-pages/stylesheets/sass/_brandsincolours.scss) file.
It will only take you a couple of seconds. I have ordered them by alphabetical order for easier use. Try to keep the same logic. :-)
